- **UI Framework**: Radix UI primitives with shadcn/ui components
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom GitHub-inspired dark theme variables
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form with Zod validation

**Component Structure**:
- Layout components (Header, Sidebar) for consistent navigation
- Page components for different routes (Dashboard, Repository, Pull Request)
- UI components using shadcn/ui design system
- Specialized components for code diff display and AI review panels

### Backend Architecture

**Framework**: Express.js with TypeScript
- **Database ORM**: Drizzle ORM configured for PostgreSQL
- **Development Setup**: Vite middleware integration for hot reloading
- **API Design**: RESTful endpoints following conventional patterns
- **Error Handling**: Centralized error middleware with status code mapping

**Storage Pattern**: Interface-based storage abstraction (`IStorage`) with in-memory implementation for development, designed to be easily replaceable with database implementations.

### Data Layer

**Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Schema Design**: Relational model with repositories, pull requests, files, AI reviews, and chat messages
- **Migration Strategy**: Drizzle Kit for schema migrations
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript integration with schema validation using Zod

  - Comprehensive code review analysis
  - Security vulnerability detection
  - Performance issue identification
  - Code quality scoring
  - Interactive chat functionality

**Review Analysis Structure**:
- Overall rating (approved/changes_requested/commented)
- Detailed metrics (security issues, performance issues, code quality score)
- Line-specific comments with severity levels
- Actionable suggestions for improvements

### Development and Build

**Development Environment**:
- Vite for fast development builds and HMR
- TSX for TypeScript execution in development
- Replit-specific plugins for cloud development

**Build Process**:
- Vite builds the React frontend to `dist/public`
- ESBuild bundles the Express server to `dist/index.js`
- Single production command serves both frontend and backend

**Configuration Management**:
- Environment-based configuration
- TypeScript path mapping for clean imports
- PostCSS with Tailwind and Autoprefixer

## External Dependencies

### Database and Infrastructure
- **PostgreSQL**: Primary database (configured via Drizzle)

### AI and Machine Learning
- **OpenAI API**: GPT-4o model for code analysis and chat functionality

### UI and Styling
- **Radix UI**: Unstyled, accessible component primitives
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework
- **Shadcn/ui**: Pre-built component library built on Radix UI

### Development Tools
- **Vite**: Build tool and development server
- **Drizzle Kit**: Database migrations and introspection
- **TanStack Query**: Server state management and caching
- **React Hook Form**: Form handling with validation
- **Zod**: Runtime type validation and schema definition

### Utility Libraries
